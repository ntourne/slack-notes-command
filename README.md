# Slack Notes Command
Slack command `/notes`. It allows to take notes from users on different teams & channels.
Built using RESTful API in Lumen, a Laravel micro framework. 

### How to use this Slack command
- `/notes look for java tutorial`  - add new note with text 'look for java tutorial'
- `/notes list`  - fetch all notes from the current channel.
- `/notes list by:ntourne`  - fetch notes reported by @ntourne
- `/notes list tutorial java`  - fetch notes that contain 'tutorial' and 'java' strings
- `/notes clear`  - remote all notes from current channel
- `/notes feedback I like this thing` - just send us a feedback note :-)
